'''User Acceptance test for UseCase 5
A tool shall be delivered that will codify some common design rules and then verify that a selected TP adheres to those rules. The tool will indicate which (if any) design rules have been violated. This tool will not cover all design rules and is not intended to be a definitive design rule test tool for TPs; rather it will cover a specific set of design rules and also serve as a template for how to use TP API.

This tool should be delivered to the community forum that will be established for the TP API; it should not be delivered with the product.

It shall be possible to read the TP from:

    a .tpi file
    a TP installed on an ENIQ server
    an XML file

Acceptance criteria:

    It shall be possible to do analyse a TP installed on the server/.tpi file/TP defined in XML (that adheres to the IWD)
    Tool will accurately indicate which aspects of a TP have violated the design rules
    Short "man page" for the tool
    Tool will output issues/errors to it's own log file
