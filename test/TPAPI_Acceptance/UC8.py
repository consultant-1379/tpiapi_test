'''User Acceptance test for UseCase 8
As a TP developer I want to be able to create a new TP from an XML file; the XML file shall adhere to the IWD.

It is not required to be able to create every aspect of a TP; it is expected that the following will be possible by manipulating/updating/creating repdb content:

    TP name and revision information
    Create new TP tables and add columns to them

It is not required to be able to do this to a .tpi file; all modify/create operations will execute against repdb on a development ENIQ server.

It shall be possible to:
1. read the new TP from XML
2. create the new TP in repdb (for the attributes outlined above)

Acceptanace criteria:

    Created TP will reflect the content of the XML for the attributes outlined above
    Created TP can be opened in TP IDE
    Javadoc for the various API methods developed
    Methods include exception handling and log issues/errors to a common log file
