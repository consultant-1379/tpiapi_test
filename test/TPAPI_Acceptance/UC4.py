'''User Acceptance test for UseCase 4
A tool will be produced that will use methods from the TP API that will output the difference between two versions of the same TP.

It shall be possible to:

    read a TP from server/.tpi/.xml
    read another version of the TP from server/.tpi/.xml
    compare the two versions of the TP
    serialise the output in human readable format

In addition a wrapper tool will be delivered that will allow users to write this diff to a file using a one line command. This tool should be delivered to the community forum that will be established for the TP API; it should not be delivered with the product.

Acceptance criteria:

    Output will accurately reflect the diff between the two TPs
    Javadoc for the various API methods developed
    Methods include exception handling and log issues/errors to a common log file
    Short "man page" for the tool
    Tool will write issues/errors to it's own log
